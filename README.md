The robot has the task of finding, grabbing and shifting aruco tagged cubes using a camera, from a rotating plate to a colour designated drop off points.

# Version Control

Though we later realised it is probably bad practice, different [Github](https://github.com/Hamo45746/Team-Terminator) branches were made and dated with the current progress at that time, to demonstrate the development of the project.
