## Overview

A controller designed for the 4R robot shown. 

<p align="center">

</p>

The robot has the task of finding, grabbing and shifting aruco tagged cubes using a camera, from a rotating plate to colour designated drop off points.  


## Download
To download the repo use the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamo45746/Team-Terminator
```

## How To Use

To clone and run this project, you will need [Ubuntu MATE v20.04](https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/ubuntu-mate-focal-fossa-release-notes/) and [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu).

To install and setup the project dependancies follow the directions in [this setup file](https://github.com/UQ-METR4202/METR4202_S2-2022_Resources/blob/main/RPi4_Setup.md) 

Once ROS is installed, in the Ubuntu terminal the controller can be launched by running the following commands (individually):

```bash
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash # once per terminal
source ./devel/setup.bash
roslaunch team12 robot_arm.launch
```
Then, in the workspace run the terminal command:

```bash
catkin build
```

Once the first camera image window appears, press spacebar to make it colour, then the controller will run.

## Version Control

Though we later realised it is probably bad practice, different [Github](https://github.com/Hamo45746/Team-Terminator) branches were made and dated with the progress at that time, to demonstrate the development of the project.
